# monkey_brain
a beginner Python exercise in a google colab notebook. 
Creating a Google Colab notebook to analyze my responses and determine the state of a hypothetical monkey_brain

**Step 1: Setting Up Google Colab**
Go to Google Colaboratory.
Click on "New Notebook" to create a new Python notebook.
**Step 2: Writing the Python Script**
We'll write a Python script that analyzes text responses. The script will determine the monkey_brain state based on the number of instructions/steps or items in a list.

**Script Overview**
*Function to Analyze Text:* This function will count the number of instructions or list items in the text.
*Logic to Determine monkey_brain State:* Based on the count, it will set the state of monkey_brain.
*Testing the Script:* We'll write some test responses to see if the script works correctly.

**Build a Frontend for it?**
